# CSS-SCSS Architectural Library

CSS-SCSS Architectural Library is a free project that I maintain in my spare time. Needless to say, it is quite a large amount of work to keep everything up-to-date, documented and relevant. 

This is a sample project using the [7-1 architecture pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and sticking to [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/) writing conventions.

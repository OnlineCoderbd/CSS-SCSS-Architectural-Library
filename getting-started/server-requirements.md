# Server Requirements

To use **Saasland** WordPress theme you need to have a WordPress 4.0 \(or higher version\) site with PHP 5.6 or more and MySQL 5.0+ running on your hosting server. If you’ve already installed WordPress on your server and your site is up, that’s great. For help regarding WordPress installation, please see this [WordPress Codex link](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress).
